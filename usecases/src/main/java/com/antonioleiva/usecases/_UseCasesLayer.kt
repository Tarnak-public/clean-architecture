    /*
It’s usually called interactors too. These are mainly the actions that the user can trigger.
Those can be active actions (the user clicks on a button) or implicit actions (the App navigates to a screen).

If you want to be extra-pragmatic, you can even avoid this layer.
I like it because it’s usually the point where I switch threads.
From this point, I can run everything else on a background thread and forget about being
    careful with the UI thread.
I like it because I don’t need to wonder anymore if something is running in the UI thread or a background thread.
